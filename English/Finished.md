How to Show that You're Finished Speaking in English 
===

Instead of using "Umm, that’s it.” Or “I don’t know what else to say.” Or, “I’m done.” we can use the following 4 strategies:  
- Make our voice go up which indicates we are not finished with what we are saying and then the voice goes down indicates that we are finished.

- In the final sentence, we really slow down our speech and we use some pauses.  
Ex. The last sentence of my story: Then ~~~~ that's ~~ when I finally realized ~~ what ~~ had happend.


- Ask a question in the end. (Strong recommend)  
Tag questions: tags are those words that come at the very end that look for agreement from someone or invite them to participate in the 
conversation.  
e.x That was a great movie, don't you think? What about you? What do you think? Do you have any thoughts?  

- For long speaking, summarize what you are saying.  
ex. Anyway, that was my weekend.  or anyway that is what happended.   
So in summary, that's why I think we should increase the budget. 
All in all, the meeting went really well.
